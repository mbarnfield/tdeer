# tdeer
`tdeer`, through its function [`tdee()`](https://github.com/mbarnfield/tdeer/blob/master/R/tdee.R), allows you to calculate your total daily energy expenditure in R. In doing so, it tells you how many calories to consume to attain your goal of gaining, losing, or maintaining weight. 

This package is pretty pointless, because there are loads of [online calculators](https://tdeecalculator.net) out there which do the job perfectly well within your browser. But if you're weird like me and want to do as much in RStudio as possible, including calculating your TDEE, `tdeer` is the package for you...

The calculations in `tdeer` are based on a [this Steel Fit USA post](https://steelfitusa.com/2018/10/calculate-tdee/).
